# Introduction

Install config tracking in your $HOME by running:
```
  curl -Lks https://github.com/griff/cfg/raw/master/install.sh | bash
```

Or in a shorter form:
```
  curl -Lks http://git.io/gcfg | bash
```

Or:
```
  wget -q0 - http://git.io/gcfg | sh
```

Your configuration is stored by default in ~/.cfg where it can be committed back to your git repository.
